# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch  
## Overview  
This project focuses on building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
The project is implemented using PyTorch and includes the following steps:

  1. Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  2. Building a CNN model.
  3. Training the model with and without data augmentation.
  4. Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
  5. Evaluating the model on the test set.
